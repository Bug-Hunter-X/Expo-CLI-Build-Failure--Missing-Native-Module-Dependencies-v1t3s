The solution depends on the specific native module and its instructions.  Generally, it involves using `expo prebuild` and then linking the native module (details vary per module). For example, if you are using react-native-camera, you would need to follow its instructions carefully for linking within the Expo environment.  Ensure that all necessary platform-specific dependencies (e.g., Pods for iOS, Gradle for Android) are installed and configured. In some cases, ejecting from Expo might be necessary, but this should be a last resort.  Always check the native module's documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date instructions.
